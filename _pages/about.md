Hi, I'm Zihao Pan, a final-year undergraduate student in Software Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University. I will be joining HKUST(GZ) to pursue a PhD, advised by [Prof. Zeke Xie](https://sites.google.com/view/zeke-xie). Currently, Iâ€™m interning with OPPO AI Center, where I focus on unified multimodal generation and comprehension. Prior to this, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Prof. Guo-Jun Qi](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/guojun-qi.html).

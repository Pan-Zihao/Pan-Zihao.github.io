Hi, I'm **Zihao Pan**, an incoming Ph.D. student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at **the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(Guangzhou)**, advised by [Prof. Zeke Xie](https://sites.google.com/view/zeke-xie). I am still an undergraduate student at the School of Software Engineering, **Sun Yat-sen University**. 

I am currently a research intern in **Meituan M17 Base Model team**. I am committed to exploring **universal and efficient multimodal foundation models**. If you are interested, welcome to email me for cooperation. I have ample GPU resources.
